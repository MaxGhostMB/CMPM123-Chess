Chess Assignment 1:

the gui allows you to set up any FEN board and allows you to exit out of existing games to set up new games to quickly debug the FENtoBoard(std::string fen) function, it handles both:
FENtoBoard("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR");
FENtoBoard("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1");

Chess Assignment 2:

"r3k2r/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/R3K2R"
